# DS-Problem-Generator-Langchain
The primary goal of this application is to assist students studying data structures in their exam preparation. It achieves this by allowing students to input a specific data structures topic and choose a difficulty level for a coding question. 
The application then leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to display a question to the user that aligns with these criteria.
